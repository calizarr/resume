## Public Projects ##

#### PhenoPiSight: Fixed Camera Greenhouse-based Phenotyping Platform<a name="phenopisight"></a> ####

  * Used Ansible to automate image capture and transfer of images from 180 Raspberry Pis on a gantry above the greenhouse
  * Developed pipeline to take captured images and make dense 3D pointcloud reconstructions (+/- 0.5cm accuracy)
  * Trained lab technicians to find phenotypes in 3D reconstructions and compare to ground-based greenhouse measurements
  * [Example of the 3D reconstruction: https://traitcapture.org/pointclouds/by-id/586a428ef7f5667846b1f8a0][traitcapture]
